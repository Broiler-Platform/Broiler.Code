/// Line numbers are not identity. Inserting one line at the top of a file moves
/// every note below it, and a review tool that stored only line numbers would
/// report all of them against the wrong code after the first edit — which is the
/// failure that makes people stop trusting such a tool and then stop using it.
///
/// So a note stores the text it was written against, and this finds that text
/// again. The rules are deliberately conservative, because a note shown against
/// the wrong code is worse than a note that admits it is lost:
///
/// * the recorded line still holds the recorded text — Anchored, no search;
/// * the text occurs exactly once elsewhere — Moved, the note follows it;
/// * the text occurs several times — Ambiguous, the note stays put and says so;
/// * the text is gone — Orphaned, the note stays put and says so.
///
/// The nearest-occurrence tie-break that a fuzzier tool would use is refused on
/// purpose. Duplicated code is exactly where a reviewer's question matters most,
/// and picking the closest of four identical blocks would answer a question
/// about one of them with a note about another.
