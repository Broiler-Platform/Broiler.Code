/// Composition for the Linux head.
///
/// The Linux picture differs from Windows in a way that matters for the support
/// claim, so it is stated here rather than discovered later.
///
/// The Linux graphics stack is an X11 surface driven by a polling loop, and
/// input arrives through evdev — raw device events, not X11 key events. That is
/// fine for the dispatcher and for input routing, both of which are real. It is
/// not fine for text input: an input method on Linux speaks XIM, ibus, or the
/// Wayland text-input protocol, and none of those are reachable from evdev.
/// Nothing in the repository implements <c>ITextInputProvider</c> for Linux;
/// the only implementation is Android's.
///
/// So this head reports text input as unavailable rather than substituting
/// something that appears to work. A user typing with an IME on Linux gets no
/// composition, and the product says so instead of silently dropping their
/// candidates.
